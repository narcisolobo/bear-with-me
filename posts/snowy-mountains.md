# The Snowy Selkirk Mountains

Wocka wocka! Hi-ho, it's Fozzie here, and today I want to tell you about my childhood in the Selkirk Mountains of Washington State. I grew up in a small cabin nestled in the heart of the mountains, surrounded by towering trees and rushing streams. It was a beautiful and magical place to grow up, and I have so many fond memories of my time there.

My mother Emily was a huge part of my childhood. She was a kind and caring bear who always put her family first. She taught me so many important life lessons, like how to fish in the streams and how to forage for berries in the woods. She also instilled in me a love of comedy and storytelling, which has stayed with me my entire life.

One of my fondest memories from my childhood was spending long summer days exploring the woods with my friends. We would climb trees, chase after butterflies, and tell each other silly jokes and stories. It was a carefree and joyous time, and I felt so lucky to have such a wonderful place to grow up in.

But life in the mountains wasn't always easy. There were times when we had to hunt for our own food, and winters could be harsh and unforgiving. But my mother always taught me to be strong and resilient, and to never give up in the face of adversity.

Looking back on my childhood now, I realize how fortunate I was to have grown up in such a beautiful and magical place. The Selkirk Mountains will always hold a special place in my heart, and I'm grateful for the lessons and memories that I carry with me to this day. Wocka wocka!
