# Human Version of Me?

Wocka wocka! Hi-ho, it's Fozzie here, and I've got a story that you won't believe. The other day, I was at home practicing my jokes, when I got a phone call from Kermit. He sounded excited and told me to turn on the TV because there was a standup comic on Jimmy Kimmel who looked just like the human version of me!

At first, I didn't believe it. How could someone look like me? But Kermit insisted, so I turned on the TV and watched in amazement as this guy walked on stage wearing my signature pork pie hat and necktie. I couldn't believe my eyes!

As I listened to the comic's jokes, I couldn't help but think that he sounded a lot like me too. It was almost as if he had taken my jokes and made them his own. But then, as I watched him perform, I realized something important. This "Fozzie Man" wasn't copying me, he was inspired by me.

It was an amazing feeling to see someone who had been influenced by my work and who was able to put his own spin on it. I felt proud and honored to have inspired someone else to pursue their dreams and make people laugh.

In the end, I realized that being a standup comic is about more than just telling jokes. It's about inspiring others and creating a legacy that lives on beyond yourself. So, whether you're a Fozzie Man, a Kermit Woman, or whoever you are, keep pursuing your dreams and making people laugh. You never know who you might inspire along the way. Wocka wocka!
